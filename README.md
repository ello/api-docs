# Ello API Documentation

This documentation is a work in progress. We are slowing pulling over documentation from our internal api docs as we update endpoints.

The documentation is currently primarially focused on consumption - a side effect of our migrating endpoints to [apex](https://github.com/ello/apex) for performance.

Please use the issues list for questions and particular API endpoint documentation requests.


## Code of Conduct

Ello was created by idealists who believe that the essential nature of all human beings is to be kind, considerate, helpful, intelligent, responsible, and respectful of others. To that end, we will be enforcing [the Ello rules](https://ello.co/wtf/policies/rules/) within all of our open source projects. If you donâ€™t follow the rules, you risk being ignored, banned, or reported for abuse.
